    This plugin loads benchmark results in Jenkins and evaluates them.<br></br>
    To decide on the build status, upper and lower bounds for concrete metrics and relative changes can be set.<br></br>
    The results can be viewed in tables and line diagrams. The configuration is done via a graphical user interface.
